    "text": "Lire cet article\n\nSelon le professeur Didier Bompangue responsable académique de l’ECOM ALGER qui s’est récemment muté et INOHA (Institut One Health pour l’Afrique), la maladie ne fonctionne pas de façon isolée dans un système. Les maladies notamment les maladies infectieuses sont dans un approche systémique. Et les approches systémique dans ce cadre de l’approche écologique, la maladie est regardée dans ce continuum. Dans la recherche de moyen de lutte contre ces maladies, on doit intégrer les concepts de bases par rapport à l’écologie, énoncer les principaux outils et réunir les éléments nécessaires à la conception d’une étude sur une approche écologique (à travers un exemple concret).\nPour tout travail de recherche, l’approche reste la même comprenant  : une question de recherche, des hypothèses, des objectifs, la partie matériels et méthodes, les résultats et la discussion (IMRAD ou IMRED).\nEn énonçant le problème, l’utilisation des principaux outils statistiques est très capitale.\nL’éco-épidémiologie ne se limite pas seulement sur le temps, lieu et espace (’approche classique de l’épidémiologie), mais on s’occupe aussi de ce qui se passe avant et après l’épidémiologie.\nLa particularité des approches écologiques est de prendre toutes les disciplines possibles pour répondre à un problème de santé (approche « one health » ou « Socio-Ecological system »), ce n’est pas non plus une juxtaposition des différentes disciplines mais il y une organisation de toutes ces disciplines autour de la question avec un chef d’orchestre qui harmonise les interventions de chaque disciplines sur la question.\nLes contraintes dans cette entreprise sont multiples car le monde est très sectorisé et ce statut hybride est une sorte de faiblesse cependant il est important dans la réalisation. Il exige un travail en équipe interdisciplinaire.\nD’autres contraintes sont liées aux difficultés à croiser des données (limites des études). Pour arriver à faire le matching des données, les règles de collectes et de production doivent être les mêmes. L’approche écologique de l’épidémiologie des maladies infectieuses considère la maladie dans un continuum, en intégrant divers concepts et outils écologiques pour concevoir des études sur l’incidence et la prévalence des maladies au sein de la population.\nSa méthodologie de recherche inclut les étapes classiques de la recherche selon l’IMRAD (question de recherche, hypothèses, objectifs, matériaux et méthodes, résultats et discussion). Cependant, au-delà des dimensions temporelles (présent), spatiales et géographiques, elle approfondit la notion de temps en y intégrant les dimensions temporelles antérieures et postérieures à l’épidémie.\nElle utilise toutes les disciplines possibles pour répondre à un problème de santé, nécessitant une organisation harmonisée ainsi qu’un travail d’équipe interdisciplinaire.\n\nCe lancement fait suite à la dixième année d’anniversaire de son précurseur, le Master ECOM ALGER (Master en Écologie des Maladies Infectieuses, Gestions du Risque et aléas atures.), qui était un service attaché au Département des Sciences de base dans la faculté de Médecinde l’Université de Kinshasa. La naissance de cette nouvelle intstitution de recherche au sein de la faculté de Médecine de l’Université de Kinshasa (UNIKIN) qui a une vocation internationale offrant des enseignements dans le cadre des approches systémiques pour lutter contre les problèmes de santé complèxes qui necessitent des solutions pluridisciplinaires dont le One Health dite “une Seule Santé”.\n\nNous avons eu l’opportunité de participer dans ces activités étant donné que l’ECOM ALGER actuel INOHA est notre Alma mater dans le omnde de rechercheur que nous sommes entrain de réaliser actuellement.\nLire plus:\nL’INOHA offre des cours de haute qualité avec un personnel qualifié de divers horizons."
